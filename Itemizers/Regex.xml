      This is bugged. I can get my group's names into the Navigator, but
      then I'm left with an itemizer that misses it's opening tag as a part of
      the item. Either of the following should be possible instead:
          
          named.capturing.group > group.begin:capture(itemizer-firstused) ~ capture.name:not(punctuation):capture(name)
          named.capturing.group:has-child(capture.name:not(punctuation):capture(name)) > group.begin
          
      Unfortunately, either I've done something wrong, or there's a bug in the
      engine and we can't do that.
